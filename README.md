Discord Webhook that provides automatic updates of SG Covid situation



What is this for?

A small project that I made in like 10 minutes out of code from some other projects of mine, for a small Discord server.

[What do I need to run it?]
- discord_webhook (PyPI)
- Firefox
- geckodriver
- Selenium With Python
- A computer
- Access to a Discord server

[Can I use it?]
Sure, just don't pass it off as yours. It's licensed as GNU GPLv3.




If someone at the SG government wants this to be taken down, I will do so. 

I'm probably not going to touch this ever again.
